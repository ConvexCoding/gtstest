# gtstest
This project is a test bed for developing an set of error analyses functions to add to lenskit.

This project uses 4 of the same lib/*.ts files from lenskit to aid in developing the errorfunction.ts file. This file contains two functions for calculating data used on the main page of the lenskit web site: "Error Func" and "WFE Error." There are also several other functions in this file that can be used to generate WFE map and  the spot diagram. These last two functions may be superceded by GPU functions if needed.

The "errorfunctions" functions are vetted in the main TEST1.TS file.
